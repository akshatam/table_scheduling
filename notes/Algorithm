The problem statement, can be thought of as a special case of 
OS process scheduling.

The restaurant can be thought of as the processor.
Tables sizes as resource capability.
Eating time as the burst time.
And customers as jobs with various resource requirements and burst times.

This can be solved in a hybrid shortest job first algorithm, which also
checks for the resources, and time is a random parameter.
